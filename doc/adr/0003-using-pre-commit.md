# 3. Using pre-commit

Date: 2025-11-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There's a lot of rutine work of checking license headers etc to review each time

## Decision

Use pre-commit as automated hooks to not doing manual work

## Consequences

No rutine work of validation, but need to find with configuration & probably self-develop several hooks to integrate to this repo
